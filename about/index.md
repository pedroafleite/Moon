Writing code is like spelling magic. One line and, puff, a whole world opens up.

And an open world is what I aim for. I learned as a geologist that understanding physics and chemistry makes us admire even more the natural beauties of Earth. I learned as a Master of Science in Geosciences and Environment that us, who populate the planet’s surface, need to live in harmony with Earth’s systems.

At the rims of the Amazon Forest, I developed my Master’s thesis, in which I applied machine learning methods to mineral chemical compositions to determine how far were we from gold deposits. To understand how to do that, I sank myself in books — coding, databases, statistics, probability, and artificial intelligence. The methods I developed promise to enhance the precision to search for ore deposits in the Amazon Region, and consequently, to reduce deforestation and the environmental impact of artisan mining.

After years in the academy, I realised that my efforts would be more effective if I were to apply them directly to markets, which more permeable to the needs of society and the environment. I comprehended that my tools are universal and they have applicability beyond the Natural and Exact Sciences. I, as a generalist, could leave my comfort zone to help people get comfortable, in a time that it is most needed.

Be welcome, be well.
